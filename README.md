A music application UI Macropad

### Purpose

I made this macropad for Hack Club's Highway using their [Hackpad Tutorial](https://hackpad.hackclub.com/). It's meant to be used as an accompaniment to music applications, primarily Youtube Music (which I use), as a physical UI. I like to listen to music 

### Features
- An OLED meant to display info such as:
  - Song name/duration
  - Whether song is played/paused
  - Whether shuffle or loop (playlist or song) is on
  - More ideas in the future if I come up with any :)
- A rotary encoder switch that changes the volume and mutes the music application when pressed
- Keys for rewind/prev track, play/pause, fast forward/next track, loop, and shuffle
- A Mini-E LED which, for now, is meant to serve as an indicator that the macropad is on
- QMK Firmware
